# WristPlayer

WristPlayer is a basic YouTube application for Apple Watch. Search, play, control and listen to YouTube videos right on your Apple Watch.

Note: An iPhone, while not physically used, is still needed nearby.

# Installation

 * Clone this repostory and install WristPlayer with Xcode

 * Or download [WristPlayer.ipa](https://github.com/Ziph0n/WristPlayer/releases/tag/v1.0) and install it with Cydia Impactor (not sure how well Cydia Impactor handles Apple Watch applications. If it doesn't work, use the first method)
